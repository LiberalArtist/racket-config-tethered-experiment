# racket-config-tethered-experiment
## `main` branch

[See also the `test` branch](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/racket-config-tethered-experiment/tree/test), which is more interesting right now!

--------

This repository is for sharing my attempt to set up a changed Racket configuration, as suggested here: https://groups.google.com/g/racket-dev/c/dHAFwzlFwNA/m/xfVGxIYaAgAJ

The most interesting files are probably [etc/racket/config.rktd](etc/racket/config.rktd) and [setup.sh](./setup.sh).

Note that it doesn't currently work!
