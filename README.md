# racket-config-tethered-experiment

This repository is for sharing my attempt to set up a changed Racket configuration, as suggested here: https://groups.google.com/g/racket-dev/c/dHAFwzlFwNA/m/xfVGxIYaAgAJ

The most interesting files are probably [etc/racket/config.rktd](etc/racket/config.rktd) and [setup.sh](./setup.sh).

Note that it doesn't currently work!
